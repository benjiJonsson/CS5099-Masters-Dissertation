Reference: Sudoku Creation and Grading. 
https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sudoku_Creation_and_Grading.pdf

The purpose of this script is to input puzzles directly into 
DEMYSTIFY to get an idea of what MUSSize's relate to what 
difficutly levels. 

To start, will input puzzles of five different diffcutly levels 
from https://sudoku.com and see the output. From there, I will 
set puzzle diffculty of each puzzle within some MUSSize band 
and personally try each puzzle to udnerstand the grade.
